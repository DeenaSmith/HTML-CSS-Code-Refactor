# HTML-CSS-Code-Refactor
UTSA Challenge 1

  The goal of this project is to successfully demonstrate refactoring HTML and CSS in a clean and concise manor, while allowing the application to maintain its current aesthetic and functionality. Doing so reduces the amount of unnecessary code, the clumsiness of the code, and will aid myself and other developers if the code needs to be revisited for revisions or additional content. Clear and concise code is important, so refactoring to promote such qualities will eventually improve work speed and reduce headaches.
